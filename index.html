ABOUT_US_-_7
We, at Finnair Virtual, have partnered along with our CC provider ATLAS to create a unique ATC mode. This allows keen IFATC controllers to join our VA and experience the AYVA experience as an ATC controller instead of a pilot. Our ATC controllers can file their operations as reports and progress through the ranks to become prestigious controllers of the VA. Furthermore, applicants who wish to both be apart of AYVA as an ATC and a pilot, we offer the opportunity to join both programs.
